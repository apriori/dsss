There are currently two READMEs:

1) README.overview, which doesn't provide much on how to actually use DSSS, but
   provides a description of what DSSS is and how it's useful.
2) README.software_engineers, for people maintaining software that they'd like
   to use DSSS to build.

I will eventually write a README for average end-users.
