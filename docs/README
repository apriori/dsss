There are currently four READMEs:

1) README.overview, which doesn't provide much on how to actually use DSSS, but
   provides a description of what DSSS is and how it's useful.
2) README.use, for general end-users, who just want to build software or
   install things from the net.
3) README.software_engineers, for people maintaining software that they'd like
   to use DSSS to build.
4) README.technical, which describes how DSSS works internally.
