Due to bootstrapping and platform differences, installing DSSS from source can
be a little bit complicated, but if you follow this list of steps it should
work fine:

1) Get a D compiler. DMD version 1.0 or newer should work, GDC 0.22 or newer
   should work.

2) If you currently have DSSS installed, UNINSTALL IT. To do this easily, just
   use the command 'dsss uninstall dsss'

3) Use make to build DSSS with the appropriate Makefile. If you're using GDC
   use Makefile.gdc.posix, if you're using DMD on Windows use Makefile.dmd.win,
   if you're using DMD on GNU/Linux use Makefile.dmd.posix. There is not
   presently a Makefile for GDC on Windows, I believe Makefile.gdc.posix should
   work so long as you have MSYS installed.

   To use make with a specified Makefile (in this example, Makefile.gdc.posix):
   $ make -f Makefile.gdc.posix

4) Install DSSS to whatever directory you prefer. On Unix-like systems, a
   common choice would be /usr, or /opt/d. You can also install it into your
   home directory. On Windows, a path like C:\DSSS or just C:\D is sensible.

   To install DSSS to the directory you've chosen on Unix (this may require you
   to become root, depending on what directory you've chosen):
   $ ./dsss install --prefix=<chosen directory>

   To install DSSS to the directory you've chosen on Windows:
   > dsss install --prefix=<chosen directory>

5) Add DSSS' "bin" directory to your PATH environment variable. On Unix (with
   bash):
   $ export PATH="<chosen directory>/bin:$PATH"
   On Windows:
   > set PATH=<chosen directory>\bin;%PATH%
