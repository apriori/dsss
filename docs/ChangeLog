SVN from 0.72:
        - Rebuild: Merged DMD 2.003.
        - Improved incremental build speed.

0.72 from 0.71:
        - More DMD fixes - now always compiles one file at a time.
        - Fixed -version=OSXUniversalBinary (see ticket #121).

0.71 from 0.70:
        - Much-improved README.software_engineers.
        - Fixed 'set' and 'add' commands (see ticket #102).
        - Added 'error' and 'warn' hook commands (see ticket #103).
        - Added 'binstall' subcommand (see ticket #105).
        - Added 'noinstall' setting (see ticket #106).
        - `dsss install` now installs .di files in libraries (see ticket #92).
        - Added 'installdir' hook command (see ticket #84).

          easily (see ticket #115).
        - Rebuild: Fixed configuration's "include" option (see ticket #116).
        - Rebuild: Fixed a crash bug with the highly-uncommon pragmas
          containing declarations (see ticket #117).
        - Added --config file for testing alternative dsss.conf's (see ticket
          #109).
        - Added --debug option (see ticket #108).

0.70 from 0.69:
        - Rebuild: Merged DMD 1.020.
        - Should now trim whitespace in "name" (and other) settings (see
          ticket #93).
        - Now uses 'svn export' instead of 'svn co' (see ticket #96).
        - Will now always remove temporary directories, even if the build
          failed (I decided this wasn't worth the difficulty it causes).

        - Added --test option to test built libraries.
        - Rebuild: Fixed an intermittent segfault on Windows.
        - Added --doc-binaries option to generate documentation for binary

        - Rebuild: Added proper documentation for -Dq (see ticket #90).
        - /etc will now be preferred to /usr/etc when installing to the prefix
          /usr.
        - Rebuild: Added -no-export-dynamic flag (see ticket #91).

0.67 from 0.66:
        - Rebuild: Fixed generation of libraries with DMD+GNU/Linux (see ticket

        - Added the dsss.conf option 'defaultTargets' (see ticket #64).
        - Added an option to DSSS to manually specify the URL to receive the
          source list from (see ticket #77).

0.66 from 0.65:
        - Rebuild: Fixed a bug with -listnffiles and -of conflicting (see
          ticket #66).
        - Some dsss-net-installs which failed due to the above bug should
          now work (see ticket #66).
        - Rebuild: Now (again) converts all paths to backslash-delimited paths
          on Windows. Apparently DMD only does this conversion internally in
          some scenarios (see ticket #70).
        - Rebuild: Fixed a bug with documentation generation causing a segfault
          in some situations (see ticket #74).
        - Rebuild: Again moved documentation into the compiler, to fix a bug
          causing docs to be generated without candydoc.

0.65 from 0.64:
        - Now exits with the proper exit code when a subcommand fails (see
          ticket #58).
        - Argument parsing now fails properly with invalid arguments before the
          command.
        - Now always fflush's before doing a system() call, to improve output.
        - Rearranged build order to be a bit more explicit.
        - Added the new technical README.
        - Improved the process of making universal binaries for OS X.
        - Rebuild: Added -notfound, which lists imports which correspond with
          non-existing files.
        - DSSS should now only install dependencies which are not handled (even
          if they're handled externally to DSSS).
        - Rebuild: Moved document generation back into rebuild.
        - Rebuild: Support for pragma(nolink) (see ticket #57).
        - Future versions should be upgradeable with `dsss net install dsss`
          (see ticket #26).
        - Rebuild: Made rebuild choose a D compiler at runtime when possible.
        - The 'sss' package now installs as a sourcelibrary, so it should be
          compilable during X-compilation, etc.
        - Rebuild: Fixed import timestamping.

0.64 from 0.63:
        - Rebuild: Added "rerun" mode, which acts like a more robust rdmd (see
          ticket #28).
        - Rebuild: <prefix>/include/d is always included automatically in the
          import path, so that rebuild can be used more easily in isolation
          with DSSS-installed software.
        - Added `dsss net depslist` command.
        - Made `dsss uninstall` explicitly require an argument.
        - Rebuild: Fixed -K flag (see ticket #56).
        - Rebuild: Made --prefix=<absolute path> work properly on Windows when
          backslashes are used (see ticket #53).

0.63 from 0.62:
        - Made OS X -arch, -isysroot and -framework flags work with dsss as
          well as rebuild (see ticket #27).
        - Improved documentation.
        - Merged DMD 1.013.
        - Rebuild: Added flags= variable to configuration files (see ticket #44).
        - Added predigen and postdigen commands (see ticket #49).
        - Made `dsss install` install rebuild's man page as well as DSSS' (see
          ticket #47).
        - Rebuild: Added -gui flag (see ticket #50).

0.62 from 0.61:
        - Added man page for DSSS.
        - Made --prefix and family work with relative paths (see ticket #37).
        - Rebuild: No longer links the same library more than once in a row
          (though it will still link it multiple times in total, due to
          complexities of Posix linking) (see ticket #39).
        - Rebuild: Made export_version accept an identifier as well as a string
          (see ticket #40).
        - Rebuild: Now closes the response file properly after using it (see
          ticket #42).
        - Rebuild: Now supports comments in response files (see ticket #43).
        - Rebuild: Allow -arch and -isysroot flags on OS X (see ticket #27).
        - Rebuild: Added path= variable to config files (see ticket #29).
        - sources directory is now created during dsss install (see ticket #36).
        - Rebuild: Executable file name is based on the first source file, not
          the first object file (see ticket #44).

0.61 from 0.60+0.18:
        - Rebuild: Fixed a (potential) segfault bug in rebuild with modules
          with no module declaration.
        - Rebuild: Made a bit less intolerant of modules with no module
          declarations.
        - Rebuild: Fixed some problems with dmd-win profile.
        - Synchronized DSSS and Rebuild version numbers.

        - Misc. bug fixes.
        - Rebuild: Fixed -clean to only remove generated files. (see ticket #20)
        - Rebuild: -J is now passed through properly.
        - Rebuild: -g and -gc are now passed through properly.

        - Several bugs fixed with rebuild (0.8->0.10).
        - DSSS no longer builds libraries on DMD.

0.51 from 0.50:

        - Too many changes and improvements to iterate.

        - A minor update to work with GDC 0.21 and DMD 1.0
        - Fixed some library linking issues on DMD/Windows.

0.11 from 0.10:

0.9 from 0.8:
        - Improved library link generation to always generate the proper
          order, even with very complicated builds (such as duit)

0.8 from 0.7:
        - Give a useful error message if dsss net is run from the source dir
          (which is unsupported).
        - Added a -circular flag to dsss_build, which will make circular
          dependencies work in GDC.
        - Don't necessarily die on failed sync (though it'll die on failed
          initial sync)
        - Report errors from synchronization

0.7 from 0.6:
        - Works on DMD on GNU/Linux.

0.6 from 0.5:
        - Show synchronize commands (had previously hidden them, decided that
          showing them is the superior option)
        - Run curl in "insecure" mode (the certs are worthless anyway)

          sorts) in GNU patch on Windows.

0.3 from 0.2:
        - Switched to curl instead of wget, due to curl's superior support for
          updates based on time.
        - dsss net fetch command implemented.
        - SVN-based source list system swapped out for an HTTP-based system
          (makes a number of things more efficient)

        - Support for mirrors.
        - $ETC_PREFIX
