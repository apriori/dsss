0.53 from 0.52:
        - DSSS properly no longer builds libraries on DMD.

0.52 from 0.51:
        - Several bugs fixed with rebuild (0.8->0.10).
        - DSSS no longer builds libraries on DMD.

0.51 from 0.50:
        - Some fixes for dsss net on Windows.
        - Updates to rebuild (0.6->0.8).

0.50 from 0.13:
        - dsss_build (bud) removed, replaced with rebuild.
        - Too many changes and improvements to iterate.

0.13 from 0.12:
        - Fixed some tokenizing of dsss.conf .

0.12 from 0.11:
        - A minor update to work with GDC 0.21 and DMD 1.0
        - Fixed some library linking issues on DMD/Windows.

0.11 from 0.10:
        - Support for --prefix and --use in `dsss net` (by popular demand)
        - Allow tildes in Unix paths.

0.10 from 0.9:
        - Improved handling of installation manifest.
        - Improved path handling.
        - Fixed to work with DMD 0.177

0.9 from 0.8:
        - Improved library link generation to always generate the proper
          order, even with very complicated builds (such as duit)

0.8 from 0.7:
        - Give a useful error message if dsss net is run from the source dir
          (which is unsupported).
        - Added a -circular flag to dsss_build, which will make circular
          dependencies work in GDC.
        - Don't necessarily die on failed sync (though it'll die on failed
          initial sync)
        - Report errors from synchronization

0.7 from 0.6:
        - Works on DMD on GNU/Linux.

0.6 from 0.5:
        - Show synchronize commands (had previously hidden them, decided that
          showing them is the superior option)
        - Run curl in "insecure" mode (the certs are worthless anyway)
        - Ignore output from bsdtar, which is almost exclusively false
          negatives.

0.5 from 0.4:
        - Fixed rmRecursive to work on Windows.
        - Fixed installation to work on Mac OS X.
        - Fixed dependency tracking to work for software with special sections.

0.4 from 0.3:
        - Fixed a bug causing DSSS not to download mirrors.list (which was
          fairly docile since there are no working mirrors yet)
        - Modified to work properly on Mac OS X (hopefully)
        - Wrote simple install and use documents.
        - Added version output to the --help output.
        - dsss net list command implemented.
        - dsss net search command implemented.
        - dsss installed command implemented.
        - unix2dos is now used for all patches on Windows, due to a bug (of
          sorts) in GNU patch on Windows.

0.3 from 0.2:
        - Switched to curl instead of wget, due to curl's superior support for
          updates based on time.
        - dsss net fetch command implemented.
        - SVN-based source list system swapped out for an HTTP-based system
          (makes a number of things more efficient)

0.2 from 0.1:
        - Support for subdir types in dsss.conf.
        - Support for mirrors.
        - $ETC_PREFIX
