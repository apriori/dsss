0.6 from 0.5:
        - Show synchronize commands (had previously hidden them, decided that
          showing them is the superior option)
        - Run curl in "insecure" mode (the certs are worthless anyway)
        - Ignore output from bsdtar, which is almost exclusively false
          negatives.

0.5 from 0.4:
        - Fixed rmRecursive to work on Windows.
        - Fixed installation to work on Mac OS X.
        - Fixed dependency tracking to work for software with special sections.

0.4 from 0.3:
        - Fixed a bug causing DSSS not to download mirrors.list (which was
          fairly docile since there are no working mirrors yet)
        - Modified to work properly on Mac OS X (hopefully)
        - Wrote simple install and use documents.
        - Added version output to the --help output.
        - dsss net list command implemented.
        - dsss net search command implemented.
        - dsss installed command implemented.
        - unix2dos is now used for all patches on Windows, due to a bug (of
          sorts) in GNU patch on Windows.

0.3 from 0.2:
        - Switched to curl instead of wget, due to curl's superior support for
          updates based on time.
        - dsss net fetch command implemented.
        - SVN-based source list system swapped out for an HTTP-based system
          (makes a number of things more efficient)

0.2 from 0.1:
        - Support for subdir types in dsss.conf.
        - Support for mirrors.
        - $ETC_PREFIX
